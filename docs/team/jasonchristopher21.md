### Project: Contactmation

Contactmation is a powerful desktop based team management solution that helps its users efficiently and
effectively manage many projects and groups at once. It is written in Java and has about 18 kLoc.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to store attributes within Person, Task and Group.
    * What it does: allows the user to add custom attributes to Person, Task and Group.
    * Justification: this feature improves the product significantly by allowing the user to add any attribute
      to Person, Task or Group without boundaries, e.g. adding a field for `github`, `youtube`, etc.
  

* **Code Contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=cs2103t-t11-1&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-09-16&tabOpen=true&zFR=false&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=jasonchristopher21&tabRepo=AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=functional-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
